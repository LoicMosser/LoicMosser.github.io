I am a post-doctoral researcher with a passion `for soft robotics`, `mechatronics`, and `generative design`, particularly in integrating learning-based models to advance robotic systems. I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Strasbourg, where I focused on designing and manufacturing pneumatic soft robots. My research led to the development of a genetic algorithm, accelerated by deep learning, that optimizes the inner structure of soft pneumatic actuators using Bézier curves and Gaussian control points. I also built an instrumented additive manufacturing platform for silicone, incorporating laser profilometry to monitor production in real time and detect issues like dimensional errors or structural failures. My work has been published in journals such as [IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10232371) and [Additive Manufacturing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214860425001435), and I’ve had the opportunity to present my findings at international conferences, including ICRA 2024.

My academic background includes a double bachelor’s degree in engineering science and electronics, followed by a master’s degree in complex systems engineering, both from the École Normale Supérieure of Rennes, France. I also achieved a top-five national ranking in France’s *Agrégation* exam in industrial science. With over 200 hours of teaching experience, I’ve led courses in `industrial computing`, `mechatronics`, and `robotics` for both undergraduate and graduate students. Currently, I’m contributing to the LABCOM Lasersurf project at IHU Strasbourg, where I specialize in supervising femtosecond laser texturing processes for large, non-planar surfaces. My expertise spans `robotics`, `AI-driven design`, and `advanced manufacturing`, and I’m proficient in tools like `SolidWorks`, `Creo`, `Python`, `ROS2`, `C++`, and `TensorFlow`. I’m committed to pushing the boundaries of innovation in soft robotics and additive manufacturing.
